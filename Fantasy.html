                Takt Op. Destiny's plot revolves around music, which is another interest of mine. It is about the emergence of D2s, an invasive species that have hatred towards music. Now, 
                the ony defense humanity has against the rising catastrophe are Musicarts, young people who represent pieces of classical music; and Conductors, the ones leading them.

                Shingeki No Kyojin, more commonly known as Attack On Titan is one of the more well-known animes out there. The story takes place in 845 CE where humanity lives inside cities behind walls 
                as they try to survive from giant-like creatures known as titans. Peace ended when the Colossal Titan took down the gate of the walls allowing the creatures to enter.
